# Bounded project context

## Registry evidence

- Registry WorkObject: `branch:tirak` (`Tirak Client Partnership`)
- Knowledge pointer: `60-client-ecosystem/tirak/project-brief.md`
- Repository: `tirakplus`

## Operating invariants

- Use Codex as the default local approval governor; other clients consume
  the same packet rather than creating competing project state.
- OmniRoute is a model-call transport beneath the project rail, not a
  project or session store.

## Fields needing review

This packet needs review for the following fields before moving to
`reviewed-held`, since this tool could not confidently source them:

- `AGENTS.md (pre-existing, not overwritten — needs manual reconciliation)`

## Relocation boundary

This packet is draft-held. The move to a new destination outside the vault
remains blocked until this packet is reviewed, any flagged fields are
resolved, the packet change is committed, an exact manifest is approved,
and a separate live-apply approval exists.
